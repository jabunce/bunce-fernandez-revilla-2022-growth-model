# This is the analysis exploring how head and waist circumference and height change by age, corresponding to Appendix Figures A.2 and A.3 in the associated manuscript.


Steps to reproduce the analysis:

1) Create a project folder on your machine. Name it whatever you want.

2) Inside this project folder, put the file ``RunAll.R``

3) Also inside the project folder, create three sub-folders named (exactly) ``Code``, ``Plots``, and ``Data``

4) Inside the ``Data`` folder, put the six ``.csv`` files.

5) Inside the ``Code`` folder, put the other two ``.R`` files.

6) Open the file ``RunAll.R``. Inside it, you can set the path to your project folder. Then run its parts in order in R.

Figures in the appendix will appear in the ``Plots`` folder.
