# This is the analysis of female height using the 3-component composite model.

<br/>
Steps to reproduce the analysis:

1) Create an analysis folder on your machine. Name it whatever you want. Place it inside the project folder you created [previously](../README.md). 

2) Inside this analysis folder, put the file ``RunAll.R``

3) Also inside the analysis folder, create three sub-folders named (exactly) ``Code``, ``Plots``, and ``Data``

4) Inside the ``Data`` folder, put the files ``Berkeley.csv`` and ``Matsigenka.csv``.

5) Inside the ``Code`` folder, put all the other files.

6) Open the file ``RunAll.R``. Inside it, you can set the path to your analysis folder. Then run its parts in order in R.

Within ``RunAll.R``, you can run sections for the 3- and 5-component composite models, JPA-1 model, and SITAR model independently, and in any order.

Figures will appear in the ``Plots`` folder.
