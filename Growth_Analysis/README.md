# Analysis of height and weight growth of Matsigenka and U.S. girls and boys in the associated manuscript

The analysis is organized in eight subfolders corresponding to different sub-analyses of female and male height and weight growth described in the main text and in the appendices. Each of these sub-analyses can be completed independently of the others, in any order. However, before you can make many of the composite figures in the manuscript, you will need to complete all eight sub-analyses.

Once the eight sub-analyses described above are completed, the ninth subfolder ``combined_plots`` contains scripts that can be run to create the figures in the manuscript and appendices. 

Within each subfolder is a ``README`` file, giving further instructions.

**To reproduce all analyses and create all figures in the manuscript:**

1. Create a project folder on your machine. Name it whatever you want.

2. Within this project folder place the nine subfolders.

3. Follow the instructions within each subfolder's ``README`` file.

4. Run the contents of the ``combined_plots`` subfolder last.
