This is the analysis of height and weight growth of Matsigenka and U.S. girls and boys in the associated manuscript.

The analysis is organized in four folders corresponding to male and female height and weight growth. Each of these sub-analyses can be completed independently of the others, in any order. However, before you can make many of the composite figures in the manuscript, you will need to complete all four sub-analyses.

Once the four sub-analyses described above are completed, the fifth folder ``combined_plots`` contains scripts that can be run to create several of the composite figures in the manuscript. 

The ``analysis_height_mal`` folder contains analyses using the 5-component composite model, the JPA model, and the SITAR model.

Within each subfolder is a ``README`` file, giving further instructions.


To reproduce all analyses and create all figures in the manuscript, first create a project folder. Name it whatever you want.

Within this project folder place the five subfolders.

Follow the instructions within each subfolder's ``README`` file.

Run the contents of the ``combined_plots`` folder last.
